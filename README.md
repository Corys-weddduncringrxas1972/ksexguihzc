Wow, okay, so, just stumbled out of the theater, The It right?? Or was it Feeds? Either way, I’m like so dazed right now I can't even. That   was wild, man. You know when you don’t expect to see a frog inflate like a balloon and suddenly become this existential philosophical mouthpiece? And BAM there it is, just like when I dropped half my popcorn in surprise. Theater's still kinda buzzing, and I’ve got popcorn crumbs stubbornly lodged between my teeth. Why did I even get the large?

Oh, that scene with the whispers – dude, it felt like someone was blowing disjointed puzzle pieces straight into my ear. I remember someone—maybe Jess?—telling me to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , but honestly, I need a brain shower before I even think about that. Such a cacophony, like a mad circus hitting a fever pitch, and I should know, right?

> There was a moment, maybe halfway, or was it near the beginning? Where the colors just melted together. It was like staring into a lava lamp but also kinda like that time I accidentally left paint cans open in the trailer, and the whole place smelled like a rainbow on fire. Back’s aching from those weird theater seats made for humans with octopus proportions. 

The creature! Oh my god, the creature, it was either terrifying or my uncle Larry after a rough night out—I couldn’t tell. But the texture, like scrubbing a porcupine with a wet sponge, and you could almost feel it. Reminder to self: get chiropractor phone number from Steve. Theater had this ambient sound that just made everything feel like it was happening in a fishtank full of whispers and old, forgotten radio signals. 

I forgot – what was that part with the shadow puppets that danced like aggressive spaghetti? Whoever told me to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   was either a genius or they hid mushrooms in my sandwich again. Now everything feels like it's tinged with some sort of rustic charm like clockwork mice scampering through a haunted cuckoo clock. 

Something about the   diving into the galloping heart of darkness but in a way that you accidentally stumble upon when you’re just looking for somewhere to park your elephant. Clown shoes will feel normal compared to figuring out this 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮.

      return What even is this.

Just ignore that – brain's on the fritz. You're probably laughing or confused—me too, friend, me too.
